# SMS Spam Classification

This repository implements an SMS spam detection system using supervised text classification.

The project focuses on preprocessing raw SMS messages, extracting textual features, and training a classification model to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.

---

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- Clean and preprocess SMS text data
- Convert text into numerical representations
- Train a classification model for spam detection
- Evaluate performance using standard classification metrics
- Fine-tune a pretrained model (where applicable)

---

## Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled SMS messages with two classes:

- Spam
- Ham (non-spam)

Basic preprocessing is applied, including text normalization and noise removal.

---

## Model

- Classification task: Binary (Spam vs Ham)
- Training: Supervised learning
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
